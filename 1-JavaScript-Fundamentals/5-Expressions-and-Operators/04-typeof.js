/*
Typeof 

typeof is a reserved keyword in javaScript that does exzctl
what it says. it returns the typ of the value in question. 
the proper syntax is typeof x 

consider the following 

let x = 2; 
let y = 'hello';
let z = false; 


practice 
1) in typeof.js create several varialbels and give them differnet value types. 
use typeof on each to pring the type to the conosle.

2) write a program, that has different outcomes depending on the type
of value used. you can use if/else, switch , or ternary operators. for and extra challenge do all 3.
