            ********* For Of Loops **********

            For of Statement creates a loop that iterates over iteratble objects.. 
                    Array 
                    Map 
                    Set 
                    Arguments etc. 

            for of   is particular useful for iterating over other kinds of collections. Cannot iterate over objecs, so for in works in the best for dealing with objects. 
            for loops where introduced in ES6. they are excelent for iterating over arrays. 


            For in     vs        for of 

            for in loops are used best for objects         where for of loops are great for iterating over arrays. 

        take the example. I want an arry of cat names, and i want to console eah name and "says meow". if it try and do it in a for in loops, i wont get what im looking for. Take the below code. 


        */
       
// var catArray = ['tabby', 'british shorthair', 'burmese', 'main coon', 'rag doll'];

// for ( var cat of catArray) {
//     if( cat == 'main coon' ) {
//         console.log(cat, 'Says nothing.. Terror floods over your body as it Just Eats your Children')
//     } else { 
//         console.log(cat, 'Says meow')
//     } }
